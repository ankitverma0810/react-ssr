# React Server Side Rendering
A baseline for server side rendering for your React application.

## Getting started
Clone the repo with
```git clone https://github.com/ankitverma0810/react-ssr.git```

Install dependencies with
```npm i```

Run dev mode with
```npm run dev```

Now open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you get your server rendered React app. You can inspect the page source and see that the html coming from your local server has all the nodes defined in the React app.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
